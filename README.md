# NewbCSS

I started this project to further learn the intricacies of a good CSS framework, better grasp and apply W3 accessibility principles, and make something usable across pet project sites. I don't think this should gain any traction against the likes of Bootstrap, Foundation, or Skeleton, but all of those seemed too large or too minimal for my needs.

That said, I'm much more interested in learning and creating than maintaining this as a project proper; But feel free to fork, add and remove, and submit a PR to see if that's something that others might also benefit from.
